#10000 hours tracer
Want to be proficient at something, one need to spend 10000 hours to it.  
The APP is used to set the target and trace every hour you spent on it.  
- by simple is just a record, store on local, even not use database, show the percentage.
- daily notice/alarm
- not only 10000 hours, also 10000 times, general reproduce task tracer(kill how many bugs, cheat how many girls, etc).
- associate with some social account, can share/show the target and process with friends.
- find/recommand someone who has same target/interest, and provide communication/make friends with them. The user can make pair/make cycle between them to help each other.
- provide more service(charged?), such as   
 - advertisement for education institution/standalone teacher
 - provide master/advisor
 - cooperate with offline education institution
 - provide offline talk
- provide API, integrate with other APPs, automatically do recording(How many twitter has posted, how many steps has walked, how many word has memoried, etc) and show(auto post on public)

##key issue
How to get as much as possible user came in.  
Not everyone want to be proficient at something.  
Not very much person can really learn/do something by self-motivate for such a long period(10000 hours, 2 hours everyday, almost 14 years; even 1000 hours is almost 1 years). So it's hard to say how many people will stay on this app for such a long time.  
Some APP already has functions like trace, find pairs, they focus on one point, that's the essential difference between mine?
