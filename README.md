As a developer, if you want to continue this job, you need to train yourself continuously.
The mobile and social is the current and also the future, just challenge yourself.

What's the app like?
1. Simple.apk, can install/uninstall on my phone.
2. A window, a tab, when push the tab, show the "hello world" whereever.
3. And a tab, to close/exit the app.

The first app just do as simple as you can, even not have to write a line of code.
Let's see how fun it is, and how fast leanring you are. 

For foucus on the task itself, the first app just need be able to run on my phone, 
if need code writing, use Eclipse on windows.

In case you are too lazy or forget about this task, I'll put daily trace here.
